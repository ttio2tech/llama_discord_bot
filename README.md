# llama_discord_bot ðŸš€
A discord bot using the research llama model 

I was able to run the LLaMA models on 3080Ti. (research only) 
As it's a quick hack, the code will get cleaned and uploaded soon. 
Meanwhile, if you want to try it, I hosted a discord bot (running the 13B version) for my server (free access). 

The server invite is [https://discord.gg/SgmBydQ2Mn](https://discord.gg/SgmBydQ2Mn).

There is also a video demo: [https://youtu.be/CRI0RMrgCuo](https://youtu.be/CRI0RMrgCuo).
